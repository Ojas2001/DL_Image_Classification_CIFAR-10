# DL_Image_Classification_CIFAR-10

## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to build and train a deep learning model for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a benchmark dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different classes. The goal of this project is to accurately classify images into one of these categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Dataset

- **CIFAR-10** contains 10 classes:  
  airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.
- The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

## Model Architecture

The core of this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is well-suited for image recognition tasks. The network learns to extract hierarchical features from the images and performs classification into the 10 classes.

## Training

- The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 training set.
- Standard loss functions and optimizers (such as cross-entropy loss and Adam or SGD) are used.
- Training is performed over multiple epochs, with validation to monitor performance and prevent overfitting.

## Evaluation

- The model's performance is evaluated on the test set using metrics such as accuracy and loss.
- Visualizations and confusion matrices can be used to further analyze model predictions and errors.
